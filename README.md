Altium hardware design files for Intelliclone PCB.

This design has been fabricated and tested using PCB's fabricated by offshore fabricators.  Its a very simple 2 layer PCB and is cheap to fabricate.  I have added the gerber files and BOM outputs for anyone who just wants to build boards.

The interfaces were reverse engineered from an Intellitouch i7 controller.  All Pentair interfaces should be identical
at the controller (i5-i9).  My reverse engineering was documented here to get a list of the signals on the connector.
